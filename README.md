<!-- /statamic:hide -->

This repository contains the source code for Static Cache Manager, a simple little utility to clear paths in your static cache.

## Installation

First, require Static Cache Manager as a Composer dependency:

```
composer require doublethreedigital/static-cache-manager
```

And that's you done! The utility should now show in the Control Panel.

## Documentation

1. Go to Utilities in the Statamic CP
2. Click on 'Static Cache Manager'
3. Enter in the paths you'd like to clear and click 'Clear'
4. Hey presto! Static caching paths have been cleared.

## Sponsor Duncan

This addon is open-source, meaning anyone can use this addon in their sites for **free**!

However, maintaining and developing new features for open-source projects can take quite a bit of time. If you're using Static Cache Manager in your production environment, please [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/duncanmcclean) (Duncan McClean) for a couple dollars a month.

## Security

Only the latest version of Static Cache Manager (v1.2) will receive security updates if a vulnerability is found.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to Duncan straight away, [via email](mailto:security@doublethree.digital). Please don't report security issues through GitHub Issues.
